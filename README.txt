The hw2.m function plays through each note with each type of synthesis. For brevity sake, I decided to keep the duration of each note .2 seconds, because this sounded better for some of the synthesis types. The chord length is still 4 seconds, but for some instrument types this doesn't sound as good.

I implemented just chords, but I decided to hard code the chord types, because it was not sufficient to just read off the sequence of notes. 

The chowning bell function shows some of the experimentation I did while preparing this assignment. 

Discussion:

A) The equal tempered chords seem to attack more. They seem to be a little louder and forward.
B) I think the equal sounds better for this reason, it is slightly more interesting. 
C) I don't hear as much difference between the minor chords. Maybe the equal tempered one is slighly more laid back. 
D) I can't really say one sounds better. The difference between them isn't profound enough.

However for both, the minor chord seems a little lower pitched.
